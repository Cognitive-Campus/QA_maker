Calculate the percentage of classes attended by the student in the course code MG-481.,"To calculate the percentage of classes attended by the student in the course code MG-481, we need to divide the number of classes attended by the total number of classes for that course, and then multiply by 100.

From the context, we can see that the total number of classes held for MG-481 is 160, and the number of classes attended by the student is 18. Therefore, the percentage attended can be calculated as follows:

(18 / 160) \* 100 = 11.25%

So, the student attended 11.25% of the classes for the course code MG-481.","Report Generated on 19-MAY-24NED UNIVERSITY OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY -
